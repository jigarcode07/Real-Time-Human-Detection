I’m thrilled to share my latest computer vision project—a robust AI-powered system that detects and tracks humans in real-time video streams with high accuracy!

🔍 What It Does:

-Detects humans in videos using YOLOv8 (state-of-the-art object detection).

-Tracks individuals across frames using DeepSORT, assigning unique IDs for consistent monitoring.

-Estimates poses (optional) via MediaPipe for advanced behavioral analysis.

-Optimized for real-time performance (~30 FPS on a standard GPU).

🛠 Tech Stack:

-Python + OpenCV (video processing)

-Ultralytics YOLOv8 (detection)

-DeepSORT (multi-object tracking)

-MediaPipe (pose estimation, optional)

💡 Key Features:
✅ High Accuracy: Minimizes false positives/negatives in crowded scenes.
✅ Scalable: Works on videos, webcam feeds, or RTSP streams.
✅ Modular Design: Easy to extend (e.g., add facial recognition or anomaly detection).

🌍 Real-World Applications:

Surveillance: Enhanced security monitoring.

Retail Analytics: Customer movement tracking.

Sports/Fitness: Athlete pose analysis.

Smart Cities: Pedestrian flow optimization.

📌 Behind the Scenes:

Tackled challenges like video corruption (fixed via FFmpeg/OpenCV optimizations).

Balanced speed vs. accuracy by experimenting with YOLO variants (nano to x-large).

Added FPS benchmarking to ensure smooth real-time performance.
